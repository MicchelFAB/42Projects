# The ft_printf Project

The **ft_printf** project is part of the 42 curriculum and its goal is to **reimplement the standard C `printf()` function from scratch**.  
By doing so, you will learn how to handle *variadic functions*, how to manage output formatting, and how to ensure efficient memory usage.

Once completed, the lib `ft_printf()` become part of my **libft**, making it available for use in other projects.

---

## üìå Project Overview

I need to create a library named **`libftprintf.a`** containing the implementation of `ft_printf()` which replicates the behaviour of the standard `printf()` with a limited set of conversion specifiers.

The key challenge is **handling a variable number of arguments** while producing formatted output exactly as specified.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Mandatory Conversion Specifiers

Your `ft_printf()` must handle these conversions:

| **Specifier** | **Description**                 |
|:-------------:|---------------------------------|
| `%c`          | Prints a single character       |
| `%s`          | Prints a string                 |
| `%p`          | Prints a pointer address        |
| `%d` / `%i`   | Prints a signed integer         |
| `%u`          | Prints an unsigned integer      |
| `%x`          | Prints a hexadecimal (lowercase)|
| `%X`          | Prints a hexadecimal (uppercase)|
| `%%`          | Prints a percent sign           |

---

## ‚ú® Main Features

- Use of **`stdarg.h`** to manage variadic arguments.
- Reproduction of `printf`‚Äôs output formatting for the required specifiers.
- **No memory leaks** ‚Äî all allocated memory must be freed.
- Fully compliant with the **42 Norm** coding style.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

Your repository must include:

- A `Makefile` with at least the rules: `NAME`, `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`, and `bonus`.
- All source (`.c`) and header (`.h`) files.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits of This Project

- Improves understanding of **low-level C programming**.
- Teaches how to use **variadic functions** effectively.
- Reinforces **formatting and parsing logic**.
- Adds a **reusable, custom printing function** for future projects.

---

## üìñ Conclusion

The **ft_printf** is a moderately difficult but highly rewarding project.  
By completing it, you will gain deeper skills in formatting, parsing, memory management, and reusable library design ‚Äî all crucial for more complex projects ahead.
